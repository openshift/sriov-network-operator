> **Note:** sriov-network-operator maintains a list of supported NICs which it supports.
> These are stored in supported-nic-ids [configMap](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/deployment/sriov-network-operator/templates/configmap.yaml).
> The operator uses this list to enforce it only operates on NICs that are supported. For unsupported SR-IOV NICs, that is not guaranteed, but might work as well.
> To have sriov-network-operator operate on an unsupported NIC, after installing the operator, you have to add the unsupported SR-IOV NICs information to the ConfigMap
> in following format: `<nic_name>: <vender_id> <pf_device_id> <vf_device_id>`.
> Then restart the config daemon and operator webhook pods.

## Supported features per hardware

# Adding new Hardware

## Initial support
Vendors (or other parties) interested in adding a new supported hardware to the supported list of devices of sriov-network-operator
should follow the following procedure:

* Open an Issue requesting to add support for new hardware
  * Specify which hardware it is (Model, Vendor ID, Device ID)
* Perform Testing on requested hardware using:
  * Kubernetes last release
  * Either last release version or master version of sriov-network-operator
  * Note: We do not have a specifc list of test-cases however you should at a minimum ensure
      sriov-network-operator is able to properly discover your device, configure SR-IOV and
      expose them as a kubernetes node resource, and you are able to run workloads consuming
      those resources.
* Add information of what was tested to the issue opened
* Add contact point information to [vendor-support.md](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/doc/vendor-support.md), so we know who to reach out if issues arise when running sriov-network-operator against the specified hardware.
* Submit PR to add your device to this file as well as to supported-nic-ids configMap [here](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/deployment/sriov-network-operator/templates/configmap.yaml) and [here](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/deploy/configmap.yaml).
  * The tables above should be updated according to what was tested

## Continuous support
To ensure sriov-network-operator continues to operate as expected on supported hardware it is recommended that hardware vendors (or another party)
adds CI which runs against PRs in the project. Without it we cannot commit for sriov-network-operator to continue to work properly on the specified
hardware.

Additional information on how to add Vendor/3rd-party CI can be found [here](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/tree/master/ci).

### E2E tests

sriov-network-operator offers a set of e2e tests vendors can run on their hardware. These tests utilize [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) to spin up
a Kubernetes cluster and run tests. Information on how to run e2e tests can be found [here](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/doc/testing-kind.md).
These tests may be used as part of vendor CIs added to the project to validate sriov-network-operator is able to operate
on the relevant hardware.

>**Note:** The maintainers of this project reserve the right to remove a device from the supported list if issues arise on that hardware.
> this will be done only after attempting to contact the contact point provided by a specific vendor to address the issues.
