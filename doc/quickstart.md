# Quickstart Guide

## Prerequisites

1. A supported SRIOV hardware on the cluster nodes. Supported models can be found [here](https://github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator/blob/master/doc/supported-hardware.md).
2. Kubernetes or Openshift cluster running on bare metal nodes.
3. Multus-cni is deployed as default CNI plugin, and there is a default CNI plugin (flannel, openshift-sdn etc.) available for Multus-cni.

## Installation

Make sure to have installed the Operator-SDK, as shown in its [install documentation](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/), and that the binaries are available in your \$PATH.

Clone this GitHub repository.

```bash
go get github.com/k8snetworkplumbingwg/sriov-network-operator
```

Deploy the operator. 

If you are running an Openshift cluster:

```bash
make deploy-setup
```

If you are running a Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
make deploy-setup-k8s
```

Webhooks are disabled when deploying on a Kubernetes cluster as per the instructions above. To enable webhooks on Kubernetes cluster, there are two options:

1. Create certificates for each of the two webhooks using a single CA whose cert you provide through an environment variable.

   For example, given `cacert.pem`, `key.pem` and `cert.pem`:
   ```bash
   kubectl create ns sriov-network-operator
   kubectl -n sriov-network-operator create secret tls operator-webhook-service --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
   kubectl -n sriov-network-operator create secret tls network-resources-injector-secret --cert=cert.pem --key=key.pem
   export ENABLE_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER=true
   export WEBHOOK_CA_BUNDLE=$(base64 -w 0 < cacert.pem)
   make deploy-setup-k8s
   ```

2. Using https://cert-manager.io/, deploy it as:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.3.0/cert-manager.yaml
   ```

   Define the appropriate Issuer and Certificates, as an example:
   ```bash
   kubectl create ns sriov-network-operator
   cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     name: sriov-network-operator-selfsigned-issuer
     namespace: sriov-network-operator
   spec:
     selfSigned: {}
   ---
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Certificate
   metadata:
     name: operator-webhook-service
     namespace: sriov-network-operator
   spec:
     secretName: operator-webhook-service
     dnsNames:
     - operator-webhook-service.sriov-network-operator.svc
     issuerRef:
       name: sriov-network-operator-selfsigned-issuer
   ---
   apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
   kind: Certificate
   metadata:
     name: network-resources-injector-service
     namespace: sriov-network-operator
   spec:
     secretName: network-resources-injector-secret
     dnsNames:
     - network-resources-injector-service.sriov-network-operator.svc
     issuerRef:
       name: sriov-network-operator-selfsigned-issuer
   EOF
   ```

    And then deploy the operator:
    ```bash
    export ENABLE_ADMISSION_CONTROLLER=true
    make deploy-setup-k8s
    ```

By default, the operator will be deployed in namespace 'sriov-network-operator' for Kubernetes cluster, you can check if the deployment is finished successfully.

```bash
$ kubectl get -n sriov-network-operator all

```

You may need to label SR-IOV worker nodes using `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker` label, if not already.

**Note:** By default, SR-IOV Operator will be deployed in namespace 'openshift-sriov-network-operator' for OpenShift cluster.

## Configuration

After the operator gets installed, you can configure it with creating the custom resource of SriovNetwork and SriovNetworkNodePolicy. But before that, you may want to check the status of SriovNetworkNodeState CRs to find out all the SRIOV capable devices in you cluster.

Here comes an example. As you can see, there are 2 SR-IOV NICs from Intel.

```bash
$ kubectl get sriovnetworknodestates.sriovnetwork.openshift.io -n sriov-network-operator node-1 -o yaml

apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodeState
spec: ...
status:
  interfaces:
  - deviceID: "1572"
    driver: i40e
    mtu: 1500
    pciAddress: "0000:18:00.0"
    totalvfs: 64
    vendor: "8086"
  - deviceID: "1572"
    driver: i40e
    mtu: 1500
    pciAddress: "0000:18:00.1"
    totalvfs: 64
    vendor: "8086"
```

You can choose the NIC you want when creating SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR, by specifying the 'nicSelector'.

```yaml
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetworkNodePolicy
metadata:
  name: policy-1
  namespace: sriov-network-operator
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    feature.node.kubernetes.io/network-sriov.capable: "true"
  resourceName: intelnics
  priority: 99
  mtu: 9000
  numVfs: 2
  nicSelector:
      deviceID: "1572"
      rootDevices:
      - 0000:18:00.1
      vendor: "8086"
  deviceType: netdevice
```

After applying your SriovNetworkNodePolicy CR, check the status of SriovNetworkNodeState again, you should be able to see the NIC has been configured as instructed.

```bash
$ kubectl get sriovnetworknodestates.sriovnetwork.openshift.io -n sriov-network-operator node-1 -o yaml

...
- Vfs:
    - deviceID: 1572
      driver: iavf
      pciAddress: 0000:18:02.0
      vendor: "8086"
    - deviceID: 1572
      driver: iavf
      pciAddress: 0000:18:02.1
      vendor: "8086"
    - deviceID: 1572
      driver: iavf
      pciAddress: 0000:18:02.2
      vendor: "8086"
    deviceID: "1583"
    driver: i40e
    mtu: 1500
    numVfs: 3
    pciAddress: 0000:18:00.0
    totalvfs: 64
    vendor: "8086"
...
```

At the same time, the SRIOV device plugin and CNI plugin has been provisioned to the worker node. You may check if resource name 'intel-nics' is reported  by device plugin correctly.

```bash
$ kubectl get no -o json | jq -r '[.items[] | {name:.metadata.name, allocable:.status.allocatable}]'
[
  {
    "name": "minikube",
    "allocable": {
      "cpu": "72",
      "ephemeral-storage": "965895780801",
      "hugepages-1Gi": "0",
      "hugepages-2Mi": "0",
      "intel.com/intel-nics": "3",
      "memory": "196706684Ki",
      "openshift.io/sriov": "0",
      "pods": "110"
    }
  }
]
```

Now you can create a SriovNetwork CR which refer to the 'resourceName' defined in SriovNetworkNodePolicy. Then a NetworkAttachementDefinition CR will be generated by operator with the same name and namespace. 

Here is an example:

```yaml
apiVersion: sriovnetwork.openshift.io/v1
kind: SriovNetwork
metadata:
  name: example-sriovnetwork
  namespace: sriov-network-operator
spec:
  ipam: | 
    {
      "type": "host-local",
      "subnet": "10.56.217.0/24",
      "rangeStart": "10.56.217.171",
      "rangeEnd": "10.56.217.181",
      "routes": [{
        "dst": "0.0.0.0/0"
      }],
      "gateway": "10.56.217.1"
    }
  vlan: 0
  resourceName: intelnics
```

To remove the operator related resources.

If you are running an Openshift cluster:

```bash
make undeploy
```

If you are running a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
make undeploy-k8s
```
